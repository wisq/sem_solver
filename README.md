# SemSolver

Solve any [Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/) puzzle in as few guesses as possible.

I've not extensively tested SemSolver with other Semantle results, but so far it's been able to solve everything with just two guesses.

## Why?

No, I don't actually use this to solve Semantle puzzles.  In fact, given that a daily Semantle is pretty useless if you already know the answer, I only ever run this on a Semantle that I've already solved.

Semantle was partially inspired by Wordle.  Many programmers (myself included) saw Wordle and immediately wondered, "How efficient a Wordle solver can I write?"  This is me doing the same thing for Semantle, and also learning a bit more about Elixir (especially [Streams](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html)) in the process.  If you're curious about my design process, check out [DESIGN.md](/DESIGN.md).

On a more practical level, it should be fairly easy to turn this into a "hint engine" â€” if you're stuck on a particular Semantle, it could find a word around a given score to help you out a bit.  (Maybe I'll do that the next time I get stuck.)

## Setup

Just run `mix compile`.  The appropriate dataset (~1.7 GB) will be downloaded and compiled automatically.  (This will take several minutes.)

The test suite (`mix test`) can also be used to run some basic tests against known Semantle puzzles.

## Usage

Currently there's no command-line interface.  Instead, you can solve puzzles by running `iex -S mix` and running `SemSolver.solve(guesses)`, where `guesses` is a mapping of guess words to scores (to two decimal digits).

For example, here's my (totally human) guess history for Semantle #43: ![Semantle 43](https://i.wisq.net/semantle_43.png)

And here's how fast I could've solved that with `SemSolver`:

```
iex(1)> SemSolver.solve(%{"orbit" => 4.64})
[debug] Found 1 reference words in 16ms
[debug] Matched "action" in 45ms
[debug] Total solve time was 67ms
#Word<"action">
```

Well that's not right.  Sometimes one guess is enough, but since the Semantle page only gives you two digits of precision to your answers, usually it takes a second word to triangulate the target word.  Let's try adding my second guess:

```
iex(2)> SemSolver.solve(%{"orbit" => 4.64, "massive" => 1.71})
[debug] Found 2 reference words in 14ms
[debug] Matched "greet" in 747ms
[debug] Total solve time was 762ms
#Word<"greet">
```

That's more like it.
